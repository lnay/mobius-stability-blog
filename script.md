# Intro
Hello everybody, for those who don't know me, I'm a final year PhD student here in Edinburgh uni.
In fact I just submitted my thesis two weeks ago!
My area of research is walls for Bridgeland stability conditions. This is an area of algebraic geometry
that has the attention of a fair amount of people here.
Briefly, as part of the wider movement in algebraic geometry to studying the derived category of coherent sheaves
on a variety, Bridgeland stability conditions for derived objects were created analoguously to more classical
notions of stability for vector bundles.

It's a fairly abstract area of research, yet in the final week before I submitted, I came across some
very classical mathematics, some even from the ancient Greeks, that if I had known about earlier, would
have completely changed the way I wrote my thesis.

And that is the story I want to talk about today.
For most of the audience, I hope this is an inspiration story for being more familiar with classical mathematics;
and if you're lucky, this Mobius transform stuff might solve one of your problems too.
For those in the area, this is to sell a particuliar viewpoint on certain results in the area.

# Stabs and actions

First, there's some unavoidable definitions to bring up, namely Bridgeland stability conditions.
For the purpose of this talk, the most important part is the central charge.
...
- action of GL2R+ on stabs
- action of autoequivalences on stabs
- particulars for ppas

Now if you were about to raise your hand and say "I've read the wikipedia page for that group, it's called the
Modular group, in fact it is known to act on the upper half plane by Mobius transformations",
then yes, thank you for letting me know now.

If you were not going to ask that, let me clarify what that was about.
